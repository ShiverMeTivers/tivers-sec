Mission:

Enable future missions by creating Master Mode Sockets on <P3> and <P5> to thier repspective target sets.
All forwarded ports must be accessible on <P1>

Scheme of Maneuver:
<Start>Linux/Windows Operations Station:
-<P1>172.16.1.2
--<P2>172.16.2.X
---<P3>172.16.3.X
---<T1>172.16.3.X
---<T2>172.16.3.X
---<T3>172.16.3.X
---<T4>172.16.3.X
----<P4>172.16.4.X
-----<P5>172.16.5.X 
-----<T5>172.16.5.X 
-----<T6>172.16.5.X 
-----<T7>172.16.5.X 


Credentials:
- test:testpassword

Misson Failure if:

1. You are not allowed to upload tools to any pivot. All tools must be tunnelled from the Operations Station.
2. You are not allowed to privelege escalate at any point, for any reason.
3. You are not allowed to use /dev/tcp
4. More than one ssh session is detected on <P3> or <P5>.
5. Any account is used other than test
6. All port forwards must be created on <P1>; No other pivot is allowed forwarded ports.

Instructions:
1. Install docker engine and command line interface in Windows or Linux
   - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
2. Execute the script "scenario_1.sh" with one of the following arguments:
   - up : Downloads and builds images, creates networks, and sets firewall rules for the environment on the local machine
   - down : Removes networks and containers from the local machine.
   
Notes
1. Every time "scenario_2.sh" is executed with "up" the IP addresses and Ports are randomized. Have fun! 
2. This challenge is complex and requires understanding SSH Multiplexing. Use this link for help! https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing
